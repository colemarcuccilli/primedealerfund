  },
  {
    category: "Investment",
    question: "What are the target returns?",
    answer: "We target a net IRR of 18-25% with an 8% preferred return to investors. Returns are generated through operational cash flow (quarterly distributions), equity appreciation, and exit multiple expansion. Past performance is not indicative of future results.",
  },
  {
    category: "Investment",
    question: "How long is the investment term?",
    answer: "The fund has a 7-year term with the option for two 1-year extensions. This timeline allows us to acquire, optimize, and exit dealerships at optimal valuations.",
  },
  {
    category: "Investment",
    question: "What is the fund structure?",
    answer: "Prime Dealer Fund is structured as a Delaware limited partnership. The General Partner manages all fund operations, acquisitions, and dealership management. Limited Partners are passive investors who receive quarterly distributions and annual reporting.",
  },
  {
    category: "Eligibility",
    question: "Who can invest?",
    answer: "Investments are available only to accredited investors as defined by SEC Rule 501 of Regulation D. Generally, this means individuals with $1M+ net worth (excluding primary residence) or $200K+ annual income ($300K+ with spouse) for the last two years.",
  },
  {
    category: "Eligibility",
    question: "How do I verify accredited investor status?",
    answer: "We work with a third-party verification service to confirm accredited investor status. This can be done through income verification, net worth verification, or professional certification (e.g., Series 7, Series 65, or CFA).",
  },
  {
    category: "Operations",
    question: "How do you select dealerships to acquire?",
    answer: "We target underperforming franchise dealerships in growing southeastern U.S. markets. Key criteria include strong franchise brands (Big 7 OEMs), below-average performance metrics, favorable real estate, and cooperative manufacturer relationships.",
  },
  {
    category: "Operations",
    question: "What is the 90-Day Turnaround?",
    answer: "Our proprietary methodology for transforming underperforming dealerships. In the first 90 days post-acquisition, we implement operational improvements across all seven profit centers: new vehicle sales, used vehicle sales, F&I, service, parts, body shop, and fleet.",
  },
  {
    category: "Operations",
    question: "Who manages the dealerships?",
    answer: "Our team manages all dealership operations directly. Kyle Coleman and the operating team have hands-on experience running franchise dealerships and are actively involved in day-to-day management and strategic decisions.",
  },
  {
    category: "Reporting",
    question: "How often will I receive updates?",
    answer: "Investors receive quarterly financial reports including P&L statements, portfolio performance metrics, and market commentary. Annual reports include audited financials and tax documentation (K-1s).",
  },
  {
    category: "Reporting",
    question: "When are distributions paid?",
    answer: "Distributions are paid quarterly, subject to available cash flow and GP discretion. The 8% preferred return accrues from the date of capital contribution.",
  },
  {
    category: "Legal",
    question: "What are the risks?",
    answer: "All investments carry risk, including potential loss of principal. Key risks include economic downturns affecting vehicle sales, OEM relationship changes, interest rate fluctuations, regulatory changes, and the illiquid nature of the investment. Full risk disclosures are provided in the offering documents.",
